// Start off by pseudo coding - You'll need to read each step carefully and make sure to add a main function to bring all your smaller pieces together

// Arrays - Loop through the arrays

// mainFunction

// Timer - leave this to the end and add it in because the timer is confusing

// generateQuestion function

// Use choices.length - So original thought with choice A, B, C, or D then use numbers of positioning for those choices
